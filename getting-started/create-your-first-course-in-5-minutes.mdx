LearnPack's AI Builder is a game-changer for educators, trainers, and anyone looking to share knowledge without technical hurdles. This no-code tool allows you to generate interactive, auto-graded courses on any topic, coding or non-technical, in minutes. By inputting basic details like a topic, length, and goals, the AI creates a full curriculum complete with lessons, quizzes, and exercises. You can even add custom inputs like PDFs or videos to personalize it further.

This guide walks you through the process step by step, based on the current LearnPack interface (as of 2025), including descriptions of key screens to make it easy to follow. Whether you are a teacher preparing a class, a professional developing training modules, or a hobbyist sharing expertise, LearnPack removes technical barriers and lets you focus on content.

## Create your course (step-by-step)

<Steps>

<Step title="Choose your purpose">
Selecting a purpose helps LearnPack adapt the syllabus to your needs and modality.  
**Tip:** If you are unsure, start with **Build real-world skills**. You can adjust later.

</Step>

<Step title=" Tell LearnPack what you want to learn">
Write a short sentence that describes your topic or goal.  
**Examples:** ‚ÄúBasics of photography‚Äù, ‚ÄúIntro to statistics‚Äù, ‚ÄúMarketing analytics for beginners‚Äù.

</Step>

<Step title=" Create course">
Click **Create tutorial** to start the setup flow.  
**What happens next:** LearnPack will ask a few questions to calibrate scope and depth.
</Step>

<Step title=" Estimate the duration">
Pick how long you want the tutorial to be.  
**Guidance:** Choose **Around 1 hour** for a compact session. **Around 2 hours** works for a mini-workshop. You can expand later.

<Step title=" Set your primary learning goal">
Clarify what success looks like for this tutorial.
- **Build real-world skills:** project-style steps that mirror real tasks.
- **Practice for an exam or homework:** timed checks and problem sets.
- **Prepare for a certification:** mock exams and study sheets.

</Step>

<Step title="Provide materials or start from zero">
If you have any material, upload it so LearnPack can build from that. If not, pick **No, help me create one** and LearnPack will generate everything from zero.  
**Good sources:** course outlines, PDFs, slide decks, internal docs, or videos.

</Step>

<Step title="Review and refine the proposed structure">
LearnPack drafts the syllabus with lessons, quizzes, and projects. Give feedback to tailor it to your needs.  
**How to refine:** ask for more exercises, change difficulty, remove or add steps, or replace a subsection with a new topic.

</Step>

<Step title="8) Edit lessons with AI assistance">
Once you accept the structure, your course is generated. You can edit any paragraph and ask Rigobot to simplify, summarize, explain further, change tone, insert quizzes, or add images.  
**Power move:** use **Manually edit as Markdown** when you want precise control over wording and formatting.

<Step title="9) Get help from your AI mentor">
Rigobot sits on the right panel at all times. Ask in plain language. No prompting expertise needed.  
**Examples:**  
- ‚ÄúI don't understand what this means.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúI'm stuck on this question.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúI don't remember this.‚Äù
