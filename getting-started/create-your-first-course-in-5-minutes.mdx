## Create your course (step-by-step)

<Steps>

<Step title="Choose your purpose">
Selecting a purpose helps LearnPack adapt the syllabus to your needs and modality.  
<span style={{color:"#4F46E5"}}><b>Tip:</b></span> if unsure, start with <b>Build real-world skills</b>. You can adjust later.

![Choose a purpose](/images/step1.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Tell LearnPack what you want to learn">
Write a short sentence that describes your topic or goal.  
<b>Examples:</b> “Basics of photography”, “Intro to statistics”, “Marketing analytics for beginners”.

![Topic or goal](/images/step2.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Create course">
Click <b>Create tutorial</b> to start the setup flow.  
<b>What happens next:</b> LearnPack will ask a few questions to calibrate scope and depth.
</Step>

<Step title="Estimate the duration">
Pick how long you want the tutorial to be.  
<b>Guidance:</b> choose <b>Around 1 hour</b> for a compact session, <b>Around 2 hours</b> for a mini-workshop. You can expand later.

![Duration picker](/images/step4.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Set your primary learning goal">
Clarify what success looks like for this tutorial:
- <b>Build real-world skills:</b> project-style steps that mirror real tasks.
- <b>Practice for an exam or homework:</b> timed checks and problem sets.
- <b>Prepare for a certification:</b> mock exams and study sheets.

</Step>

<Step title="Provide materials or start from zero">
If you have material, upload it so LearnPack can build from it. If not, pick <b>No, help me create one</b> and LearnPack will generate everything from zero.  
<b>Good sources:</b> course outlines, PDFs, slide decks, internal docs, or videos.

![Materials yes/no](/images/step6.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Review and refine the proposed structure">
LearnPack drafts the syllabus with lessons, quizzes, and projects. Give feedback to tailor it.  
<b>How to refine:</b> ask for more exercises, change difficulty, remove or add steps, or replace a subsection with a new topic.

</Step>

<Step title="Edit lessons with AI assistance">
After accepting the structure, your course is generated. You can edit any paragraph and ask <b>Rigobot</b> to simplify, summarize, explain further, change tone, insert quizzes, or add images.  
<b>Power move:</b> use <b>Manually edit as Markdown</b> for precise control over wording and formatting.

![Block-level AI editing](/images/step8.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Get help from your AI mentor">
<b>Rigobot</b> sits on the right panel at all times. Ask in plain language. No prompting expertise needed.  
<b>Examples:</b> “I don't understand this”, “I'm stuck on this question”, “I don't remember this”.
