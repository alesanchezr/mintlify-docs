Employee onboarding may look like a small step, but in reality it is one of the most expensive and time-consuming training processes inside organizations. Traditional onboarding materials often cost thousands to build, take months to update, and rarely achieve high completion rates. LearnPack offers a faster, smarter way to deliver onboarding that cuts costs, scales instantly, and ensures every employee is ready from day one.

## The Challenge of Traditional Onboarding ðŸ§©

- **High costs:** creating onboarding courses is expensive. Studies show one hour of interactive e-learning can cost **\$10,000â€“\$50,000** and take over **180 hours** to build.
- **Low engagement:** standard onboarding courses average only **10â€“30%** completion, with little measurable skill application in the workplace (<a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report</a>).
- **Slow updates:** when policies change, companies must redo large parts of the training. Deloitte and ATD estimate these updates add **20â€“40%** to yearly training costs.

For growing companies, this mix of **high cost**, **low results**, and **slow updates** makes traditional onboarding hard to sustain.

## The LearnPack Approach ðŸš€

LearnPack reduces onboarding training costs by up to **80%**, while doubling completion rates. Instead of relying on external instructional designers, HR teams can turn any PDF, video, or internal document into an **interactive, production-ready course in minutes**.

- **One-click course generation:** upload an employee handbook, compliance checklist, or welcome video, and LearnPack instantly converts it into an interactive learning path.
- **Rich, interactive content:** add quizzes, practical exercises, or role-based simulations in seconds.
- **Instant updates:** when policies or procedures change, HR can update blocks of content in minutes, not weeks.
- **Seamless deployment:** publish as a unique link, or export to your LMS via <a href="/publishing-and-exports/exporting-to-scorm-and-embedding-in-lms"><b>SCORM</b></a>.

## Rigobot: The AI Tutor Advantage ðŸ¤–

Every employee gets support from <a href="https://4geeksacademy.com/us/ai-powered-learning/rigobot-ai-coding-mentor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>Rigobot</b></a>. Unlike generic AI tools, Rigobot has full context of the course content and the learnerâ€™s progress.

- **Context-aware guidance:** it remembers each employeeâ€™s interactions and adapts help accordingly.
- **Proactive mentoring:** using a Socratic method, Rigobot asks guiding questions instead of giving answers, improving retention.
- **24/7 multilingual support:** employees can access help anytime, in their preferred language.

Rigobot has been reported to reduce dropouts by **50%**, making onboarding not just faster but more effective.

## Real-World ROI ðŸ“ˆ

Companies deploying LearnPack see measurable outcomes:

- **80% cost reduction:** a module that once cost **\$4,000â€“\$39,000** to develop can be produced for about **\$600**.
- **2Ã— completion rates:** employees are more likely to complete training and apply it on the job.
- **Scalable access:** for every 25 employees, LearnPack provides two monthly packages for free, which helps expansion.

## POV: A Day-One Experience ðŸŽ“

Imagine your new hire logging in on their first day. Instead of scrolling a static PDF or watching long videos, they receive a **personalized onboarding journey**. Each section includes interactive checkpoints, short quizzes, and role-relevant exercises. Whenever they get stuck, Rigobot steps in with clarifications, examples, or questions to guide their thinking. By the end of the day, HR has real-time visibility into what the employee completed, where they struggled, and how engaged they were.
