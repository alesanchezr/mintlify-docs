**Why this matters:** Corporate training is slow and expensive. LearnPack turns any PDF, video, or internal document into a **production-ready, interactive course** in seconds, while **LearnPack's AI Tutor Rigobot** delivers **hyper-personalized** guidance. ✅
</Callout>

Corporate training has historically been expensive, slow, and ineffective. Traditional instructional design requires months of work and tens of thousands of dollars to build a single interactive module. **LearnPack** eliminates that burden by turning any PDF, video, or internal document into a **production-ready, interactive course in seconds**. Companies immediately reduce training expenses by up to **80%**, while employees benefit from higher-quality learning experiences.

## Why Traditional Training Is Costly

According to the [Association for Talent Development](https://www.td.org/), building one hour of quality interactive training content costs between **$10,000 and $50,000**, with an average of **184 development hours**. Updating or customizing that material adds another **30% in yearly expenses**. The result is slow rollouts, poor adaptability, and a financial strain on companies.

At the same time, learners struggle. Industry studies, such as the [LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report), show completion rates as low as **20–30%**, with limited application of skills on the job.

| Pain point | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| High production cost | $10k–$50k per hour of content, 184 hours on average |
| Expensive maintenance | ~30% annual update cost |
| Low completions | 20–30% course completion rates |
