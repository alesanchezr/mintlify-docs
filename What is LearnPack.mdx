## 🚀 A Journey of Transformation

LearnPack started as a coding sidekick, interactive, auto-graded exercises inside developer environments.  

By 2025, it has evolved into an **[AI-powered course builder](https://www.learnpack.co/)** for any subject, accessible in the browser. Whether it’s coding, marketing, psychology, or history, LearnPack can turn raw material into a structured learning experience. No technical background required.

⚠️**Why this matters:** instead of collecting scattered tutorials, LearnPack creates a clear, measurable learning path and pairs it with contextual tutoring.
</Callout>

LearnPack began in programming education and grew into a general-purpose authoring platform. Upload a PDF, slides, or a video transcript (or start from a blank idea) and generate a **production-ready course** with lessons, quizzes, projects, and interactive tasks.

## 🔍 Cutting Through the Noise

The internet is overflowing with information; choosing a path can be paralyzing. LearnPack **creates structure**:

- Upload a **university PDF** and get a complete course: lessons, quizzes, projects.
- No material? Tell it “digital marketing from zero,” “history of philosophy,” or “Python basics,” and it will **generate an interactive course from scratch**.
- Your progress is **measured as you go**, so learning is trackable.

## 🤖 A Mentor Built In

Courses are only half the story. Every learner has doubts, gets stuck, or needs feedback. That’s why LearnPack comes with Rigobot, our AI mentor that transforms a learning experience into a hyper-personalized learning experience (and that's the key that changes the game completely).

💡**Tip:** Ship a small course first, then iterate with AI “add a quiz,” “simplify this section,” “translate to Spanish,” or “add recap images.”
