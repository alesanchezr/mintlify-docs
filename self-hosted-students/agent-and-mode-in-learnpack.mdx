# Agent and mode in LearnPack

## What is the agent in LearnPack

LearnPack is an application with various small parts connected to each other. When you run LearnPack inside Visual Studio Code, it is slightly different from running it in a browser. Due to these implementation differences, it is possible to configure LearnPack to open as a VS Code extension (<code>agent = "vscode"</code>) or to open the interface in the browser (<code>agent = "os"</code>).

### At a glance

| Agent | Where the UI opens | How it is set |
|---|---|---|
| **vscode** | Inside VS Code as an extension | Auto-detected in VS Code, or set in <code>learn.json</code> under <code>editor.agent</code> |
| **os** | In your default web browser | Auto-detected when started outside VS Code, or set in <code>learn.json</code> |

## What is the "mode" in LearnPack

LearnPack will notice in which program it was executed to determine the agent, but the agent can also be specified within <code>learn.json</code> in the <code>editor.agent</code> section. This allows users to explicitly define how they want LearnPack to be executed.

If a difference is detected between the detected agent and the suggested one, LearnPack will display a warning. This warning is important to ensure the best user experience, as each agent has its own characteristics and advantages.

For example, if LearnPack detects that it is running in VS Code but the <code>learn.json</code> file suggests that it should run in a browser, a message will be displayed recommending changing the agent to avoid potential compatibility or functionality issues.

<Callout type="tip">
<b>Tip:</b> Keep <code>editor.agent</code> aligned with where you actually run LearnPack to avoid warnings and ensure the best UI behavior.
