# How to get feedback in LearnPack

Feedback is an essential part of learning. Have you noticed while studying how people who ask the most questions tend to understand the topic better? It is because they get instant feedback on what they think.

In LearnPack, you can find feedback in different ways.

## ‚úÖ Self-assessed tests: run the checks

LearnPack exercises are usually accompanied by specific tests that indicate how your code is doing. LearnPack will show you in the terminal why tests failed if that happens, and it will also tell you when they pass. You will know if you are doing well at all times.

<b>Tip:</b> after a failure, read the assertion message, fix one thing at a time, rerun. Small loops, faster wins.

## ü§ñ AI mentoring: ask Rigobot

![Rigobot mentoring panel](https://github.com/learnpack/docs/assets/107764250/21bfa49c-b6bd-4c9e-806a-38e718f6fd39)

Artificial intelligence is one of the most revolutionary tools of recent times. Rigobot will be there to help you if you find it difficult to understand the instructions or you simply want to know more about a topic related to the exercise. Imagine that Rigobot is a tutor willing to teach you in many ways. It will understand you and explain concepts in the way you see the world.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watching solutions in video or text

Another way to get feedback is with video tutorials or solution files, when the exercise includes them. Use this option to compare approaches if the previous options did not work for you or are not available.

## Feedback channels at a glance

| Channel | What you get | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-assessed tests** | Immediate pass or fail with messages | You wrote code and want objective verification |
| **Rigobot mentoring** | Context-aware guidance in natural language | You are stuck, need hints or alternative explanations |
| **Video/text solutions** | Reference implementation or walkthrough | You want to compare approaches after trying yourself |
