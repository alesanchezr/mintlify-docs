# Start learning with LearnPack

The following explains how to open LearnPack tutorials locally or in the cloud, using your existing GitHub repositories.

## Pick your first tutorial

You can learn many things with LearnPack. What do you want to learn? Our most popular tutorials help you learn <a href="https://4geeks.com/interactive-exercise/javascript-array-loops-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">javascript arrays</a>, <a href="https://4geeks.com/interactive-exercise/react-js-tutorial-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">react js</a>, and how to <a href="https://4geeks.com/interactive-coding-tutorial/python-flask-api-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">build APIs with Python Flask</a>.

> ðŸ›Ÿ Here is a <a href="https://4geeks.com/lesson/learnpack-tutorial-database" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">curated list of our recommended tutorials</a>.

Each tutorial is a separate GitHub repository. Open the repository and read the README to understand the scope. You may find an `exercises` folder or a `.learn/exercises` path with all the steps and instructions you will follow. We also have <a href="https://4geeks.com/interactive-coding-tutorials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this curated list of tutorials from 4Geeks Academy</a> with a UI that makes selection easier.

## Run the tutorial

The easiest way to start a LearnPack tutorial is our click-and-learn bridge:

## Open any LearnPack tutorial in the cloud

> ðŸ›Ÿ Skip this section if you want to run locally on your computer.

We will use the <a href="https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-arrays-exercises-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Looping with Javascript</a> tutorial as an example.

### Opening on GitHub Codespaces

1. Open the repository, click **Code**, then **Create codespace on master**.  
   ![Create Codespace](https://github.com/learnpack/docs/assets/107764250/982084dd-0053-4ab0-b6b8-d3b2c2037fc5)
2. Wait for the codespace to load.  
3. Start reading the instructions and complete the exercises.

### Opening on Gitpod

1. Type this URL in your browser:

```txt
https://gitpod.io/#<tutorial repository url>
````

Replace `<tutorial repository url>` with the tutorialâ€™s GitHub URL, for example:

```txt
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-arrays-exercises-tutorial
```

> ðŸ›Ÿ You can also use the <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gitpod browser extension</a> to add a one-click button on GitHub.

## Download and run a tutorial on your computer

To use LearnPack locally, install **Node v20 or newer**. Some tutorials may require additional tools.

> ðŸ›Ÿ We recommend installing Node via NVM. Guide: <a href="https://4geeks.com/how-to/install-nvm-on-every-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">install NVM on your OS</a>.

**1) Install LearnPack globally**

```bash
npm i -g @learnpack/learnpack
```

**2) Clone a tutorial repository**

Example with the JavaScript tutorial:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-arrays-exercises-tutorial.git
```

**3) Enter the directory**

```bash
cd javascript-arrays-exercises-tutorial
```

**4) Start LearnPack**

```bash
learnpack start
```

If LearnPack detects missing plugins for the tutorial, it will install them. Then run `learnpack start` again.
![Needed plugins](https://github.com/learnpack/docs/assets/107764250/952ba5f4-5a7f-424e-8dfc-856f17f7a4b5)

### Use LearnPack locally with VS Code

If you use VS Code, install the extension: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=learn-pack.learnpack-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LearnPack for VS Code</a>.

Once inside a LearnPack tutorial, the extension will run **learnpack start** for you on first launch.

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Codespaces**  | GitHub account with Codespaces enabled | Zero setup, fastest start              |
| **Gitpod**             | Gitpod account                         | Cloud dev with easy launch from GitHub |
