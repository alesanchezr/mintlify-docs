# Accessibility in LearnPack

When discussing accessibility, it is important to reference web standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which provide good practices for making web content understandable for everyone, regardless of the user agent.

LearnPack considers these guidelines and continuously strives to improve the user experience, making it easier to understand.

## Colors and contrast

The primary text color in LearnPack is black on a white background. This yields a contrast ratio of **21:1**, which meets **WCAG AA** and **WCAG AAA** for normal text.

- Verify the contrast here: <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FFFFFF&bcolor=000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>LearnPack contrast</b></a>.

## Font sizes and readability

LearnPack’s font sizes follow WCAG-recommended practices. Lesson content uses a minimum of **16 px**, then increases by **4 px** for `h3`, another **4 px** for `h2`, and **3 px** more for `h1`. Lesson content is written in Markdown and converted to HTML, so **images include alt text** by design.

Additional practices for readability:

- **No justification:** avoids irregular spacing.
- **Avoid excessive uppercase:** reduces eye strain.
- **Paragraph spacing:** ~**1.5×–2×** line height between paragraphs for comfortable scanning.

## Keyboard navigation and key commands

To make LearnPack easier to use without a mouse, key bindings enable complete keyboard control:

- `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down`: scroll the page.
- `Ctrl` + `Enter`: execute the code you wrote.
- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`: run the exercise’s tests and view results.
- `Ctrl` + `Right Arrow`: go to the next exercise.
- `Ctrl` + `Left Arrow`: return to the previous exercise.
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Enter`: toggle the AI tutor if you are logged in.
