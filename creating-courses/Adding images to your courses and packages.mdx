Visuals are one of the most powerful ways to reinforce learning. With LearnPack, you can go beyond plain text and quizzes by integrating AI-generated diagrams, screenshots, and illustrations directly into your tutorials. This capability ensures students understand complex concepts faster, while instructors save hours that would otherwise be spent sourcing or designing graphics.

## Why Images Matter in LearnPack ‚ú®

- **Faster comprehension:** Diagrams simplify abstract concepts.  
- **Engagement boost:** Visual learners retain more information when lessons include images.  
- **Consistency:** Every generated image matches the context of your course content.  
- **Scalability:** No need for design software or external resources. Rigobot takes care of it.

## The Role of LearnPack‚Äôs AI mentor Rigobot in Image Creation ü§ñ

Rigobot is not just a tutor; it is also your creative partner. When building a tutorial, text and quizzes appear instantly, but images are presented differently: Rigobot pauses and asks you what type of image you want to include. This ensures every visual is context-aware and hyper-personalized.

- **Memory:** Rigobot already knows what the lesson is about.  
- **Context-awareness:** It proposes diagrams or illustrations that match the teaching moment.  
- **Flexibility:** You can accept Rigobot‚Äôs suggestion or edit the prompt to generate something else.

## Example: Photography Tutorial üì∏

Let‚Äôs walk through a real case. Suppose you are building *Basics of Photography for Beginners*.

Rigobot might propose:

> A vibrant, educational diagram of a camera dial showcasing different modes like Auto, Manual, Aperture Priority, and Shutter Priority. The image should feature a close-up of a DSLR camera dial with each mode labeled clearly using bold text and arrows. Use a color palette of warm grays and bright accents like green for Auto and blue for Manual to make it visually engaging. Include a subtle background of a blurred outdoor scene to hint at photography contexts, ensuring the focus remains on the dial for beginner learners to easily understand camera mode selection.

**Prompt preview inside LearnPack:**

**Result (dial diagram):**

If you prefer to emphasize another aspect, such as focal length, you can rewrite the prompt:

> A vibrant, educational diagram of a camera lens showcasing different focal length settings like 24mm, 50mm, and 200mm.

**Result (lens diagram):**

This process guarantees that the images always serve your learning goals, not just fill space.

## How to Add Images: Step by Step  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build your tutorial">
    Go through the regular LearnPack setup: topic, goals, duration, and purpose.<br />
    Tip: start with the <a href="/essentials/Quickstart:%20Create%20your%20first%20course%20in%205%20minutes">Quickstart (5 min)</a>.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pause at the image prompt">
    When Rigobot pauses with a proposed image idea, review whether that visual helps your learners at this point in the lesson.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the suggestion">
    Decide if the proposed diagram or illustration clarifies the concept. If not, adjust the prompt‚Äîbe specific about labels, colors, or style.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept or edit">
    Keep Rigobot‚Äôs suggestion or refine the prompt with your own instructions (e.g., ‚Äúfocus on shutter speed vs aperture‚Äù).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate and embed">
    Rigobot instantly creates and inserts the image into your course. You can regenerate or replace it anytime.
  </Step>
