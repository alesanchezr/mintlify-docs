title: Adding images to your LearnPack courses and packages
description: Step-by-step guide to generate and embed AI-created diagrams, screenshots, and illustrations with Rigobot; fully browser-based, context-aware, and aligned to your lesson goals.

Visuals are one of the most powerful ways to reinforce learning. With LearnPack, you can go beyond plain text and quizzes by integrating **AI-generated diagrams, screenshots, and illustrations** directly into your tutorials. This capability helps students understand complex concepts faster, while instructors save hours they would spend sourcing or designing graphics. ‚ú®

## Why Images Matter in LearnPack

- **Faster comprehension:** diagrams simplify abstract concepts.  
- **Engagement boost:** visual learners retain more when lessons include images.  
- **Consistency:** every generated image matches the **context** of your course content.  
- **Scalability:** no design software or external resources, <b>Rigobot</b> will handle it. ü§ñ

## The Role of LearnPack‚Äôs AI mentor, Rigobot

Rigobot is not just a tutor, it is also your creative partner. When you build a tutorial, text and quizzes appear first, images are handled with care: **Rigobot pauses and asks what image you want**, so each visual is **context-aware** and **hyper-personalized**.

- **Memory:** Rigobot already knows the lesson‚Äôs topic and goals.  
- **Context awareness:** proposes diagrams or illustrations that match the teaching moment.  
- **Flexibility:** accept the suggestion, or edit the prompt to generate something else.

## Example: Photography Tutorial üì∏

Suppose you are building *Basics of Photography for Beginners*.

Rigobot might propose:

> A vibrant, educational diagram of a camera dial showcasing different modes like Auto, Manual, Aperture Priority, and Shutter Priority. The image should feature a close-up of a DSLR camera dial with each mode labeled clearly using bold text and arrows. Use a color palette of warm grays and bright accents like green for Auto and blue for Manual to make it visually engaging. Include a subtle background of a blurred outdoor scene to hint at photography contexts, ensuring the focus remains on the dial for beginner learners to easily understand camera mode selection.

**Prompt preview inside LearnPack:**

**Result (dial diagram):**

If you prefer to emphasize another aspect, such as focal length, you can rewrite the prompt:

> A vibrant, educational diagram of a camera lens showcasing different focal length settings like 24mm, 50mm, and 200mm.

**Result (lens diagram):**

This process keeps visuals aligned to the learning goal, not just decoration.

## Quick rubric: which visual to use?

| Visual type | Best for | Prompt cues (keep it simple) |
|---|---|---|
| **Diagram** | Abstract concepts, relationships, flows | ‚ÄúLabel X, Y, Z‚Äù, ‚Äúadd arrows‚Äù, ‚Äúclear legends‚Äù, ‚Äúneutral background‚Äù |
| **Screenshot** | UI steps, button locations, settings | ‚ÄúCrop to visible area‚Äù, ‚Äúhighlight step 3‚Äù, ‚Äúblur irrelevant panels‚Äù |
| **Illustration** | Concept overviews, metaphors, engagement | ‚ÄúHigh-contrast icons‚Äù, ‚Äúclean lines‚Äù, ‚Äúsingle focal point‚Äù |

## How to Add Images: Step by Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build your tutorial">
    Go through the regular setup: topic, goals, duration, and purpose.<br />
    <span style={{color:"#4F46E5"}}>Start fast:</span> <a href="/getting-started/create-your-first-course-in-5-minutes"><b>Quickstart (5 min)</b></a>.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pause at the image prompt">
    When Rigobot pauses with a proposed image idea, review whether it helps your learners at that point.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the suggestion">
    Decide if the diagram or illustration clarifies the concept. If not, adjust the prompt: specify <b>labels</b>, <b>arrows</b>, or <b>style</b>.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept or edit">
    Keep the suggestion or refine it with your own instructions, for example, ‚Äúfocus on shutter speed vs aperture‚Äù.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate and embed">
    Rigobot will create and insert the image into your course. You can regenerate or replace it anytime. ‚úÖ
  </Step>
</Steps>
