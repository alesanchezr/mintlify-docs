<b><span style={{color:"#4F46E5"}}>What makes Rigobot unique:</span></b> it lives <b>inside</b> every LearnPack tutorial, sees your exact step, remembers progress, and adapts help in real time. No tab switching, no prompt engineering ‚Äî just <b>hyper-personalized</b> guidance. üéØ

Rigobot is what makes LearnPack unique. Instead of being a tool you open separately, Rigobot is built into the platform itself, always visible and always aware of where you are in your course. This direct integration creates a <b>hyper-personalized learning experience</b>: you keep working on your lesson while Rigobot provides context, remembers your progress, and adapts to your needs.

This guide shows how Rigobot appears on screen, how it works with your lessons, and why it is the key factor that makes LearnPack different from other AI-powered platforms.

## How Rigobot Appears in LearnPack üéØ

Rigobot is displayed as a <b>side panel inside every LearnPack tutorial</b>. The moment you start a lesson, Rigobot identifies your exact step and prepares to help.

Here, the student is on step <i>01.0 Understanding Your Camera</i> in a photography course. Rigobot immediately shows awareness of the current step and offers support. When the learner types <i>‚ÄúWhat is a DSLR?‚Äù</i>, Rigobot replies with a clear, curriculum-aligned explanation.

## ü§ñ Why Rigobot Improves the Learning Experience

| Criteria | Generic AI Assistants | **Rigobot inside LearnPack** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Context awareness** | Do not know your lesson or progress, often guess answers. | Always knows your current lesson, exercise, and step. |
| **Prompting** | Requires carefully written prompts for accurate results. | A simple ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù is enough, Rigobot understands instantly. |
| **Memory of progress** | Limited or no recall between sessions. | Remembers your history, adapts hints to your strengths and gaps. |
| **Workflow** | Separate window or tab, disrupting focus. | Integrated side panel, guidance without leaving your course. |
| **Reliability** | May provide incorrect or unrelated answers. | Bounded by the LearnPack curriculum, ensuring accuracy and relevance. |

## Examples of Rigobot in Action

- **Non-technical lesson:** While reviewing a quiz in a ‚ÄúMarketing Basics‚Äù module, Rigobot notices repeated wrong answers and asks, <i>‚ÄúHow is branding different from advertising?‚Äù</i> Instead of revealing the answer, it encourages reflection and revisits earlier concepts.
- **Technical exercise:** In a JavaScript loop task, Rigobot highlights a wrong condition and suggests a smaller test case to clarify logic. Beginners receive simplified explanations, while advanced learners might get optimization tips.

In both cases, the interface remains the same: <b>Rigobot on the right, lesson on the left</b>, learning uninterrupted.

## Rigobot‚Äôs Key Role in LearnPack

Rigobot is not an add-on; it is the defining layer of LearnPack. The side-panel presence means students are never left alone with content. It turns lessons into guided experiences, where every step includes real-time, personalized support.
