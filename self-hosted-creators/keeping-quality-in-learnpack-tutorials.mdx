# Keeping Quality in LearnPack Tutorials

<Callout type="info">
<b><span style={{ color:"#4F46E5" }}>Quality gate:</span></b> use <b>learnpack audit</b> to scan configuration, links, images, and exercise structure before you publish. ðŸ§ª
</Callout>

## Audit your tutorial

With LearnPack you can audit your repository and check for possible errors.

Run:

```bash
learnpack audit
````

## LearnPack audit errors

The audit command currently validates:

1. **Basic `learn.json`:** the configuration must include **`slug`**, **`repository`**, and **`description`**.
2. **No user or session files in the repo:** when LearnPack runs it generates session files (telemetry, login, etc.). Remove them before publishing. You can fix this by running **`learnpack clean`**.
3. **Empty or missing files:** every step must include at least one **README** file.
4. **Broken links:** scans step instructions to ensure no links return **404**.
5. **Valid image URLs (relative or absolute):** scans step instructions to ensure all images load correctly.
6. **Exercise directory names:** folders must follow LearnPackâ€™s convention, starting with a number and a descriptive name.
7. **`exercises` array contains session content:** a `contig.json` file is generated during a session and should be emptied before publishing.

## LearnPack audit warnings

8. **Inconsistent translations.**
9. **Missing `.gitignore`.**
10. **Loose files:** files inside the `exercises` folder but not within any specific exercise directory.

<Callout type="success">
<b>Tip:</b> after fixes, run <b>learnpack audit</b> again until your repository is clean. For student-side data hygiene, remind learners to avoid committing files generated under <b>.learn/</b>.
