# Configure LearnPack for delivering the package as a project

<Callout type="info">
<b><span style={{color:"#4F46E5"}}>Delivery options:</span></b> configure <b>no delivery</b>, <b>file uploads</b> (by MIME type), or <b>URL submissions</b> (via regex). You can also accept <b>flags</b> for CTF-style validations. ✅
</Callout>

One of LearnPack’s most popular features is the ability to ask students to deliver the package as homework. Here, you can configure a package to allow or not allow delivery.

## Projects with no delivery

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "formats": ["no_delivery"]
  }
}
````

## Deliver a file

Before setting up your `learn.json`, you must know which MIME types learners will be able to upload to deliver the project successfully. If you have a sample file, you can upload it to a MIME checker (e.g., mimetype.io) to retrieve the exact string.

![how to get mime types](https://github.com/learnpack/docs/blob/main/assets/mime-type.png?raw=true)

Once you get the MIME type, specify it under the `delivery.formats` array:

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "formats": ["application/pdf"]
  }
}
```

**Examples:**

### PDF file

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "instructions": {
      "us": "Please drag your finished resume as a PDF file and upload it here",
      "es": "Porfavor adjunta tu resume/CV listo y como archivo PDF"
    },
    "formats": ["application/pdf"]
  }
}
```

### Flag coming from Capture the Flag

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "instructions": {
      "us": "Paste the flag you found with format FLAG{hash}",
      "es": "Agrega el la bandera que encontraste con el formato FLAG{hash}"
    },
    "formats": ["flags"],
    "quantity": 2
  }
}
```

### Text file with multiple MIME possibilities

Sometimes, we want to allow multiple file types. In this case, the learner can upload a file from MS Word or PDF.

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "instructions": {
      "us": "Create a text document with the answers to the questions in the instructions",
      "es": "Adjunta un documento con las respuestas a las preguntas"
    },
    "formats": ["application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,application/pdf"]
  }
}
```

### Files with unknown MIME type

Some rare files like Packet Tracer `.pka` do not have a recognized MIME type. In that case, use `application/octet-stream` followed by the file extension:

<Callout type="tip">
<b>Heads up:</b> this is a last resort. Prefer explicit MIME types whenever possible.
</Callout>

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "instructions": {
      "en": "Please attach your finished pka file and upload it here",
      "es": "Por favor adjunta tu archivo pka listo y cárgalo aquí"
    },
    "formats": ["application/octet-stream,.pka"]
  }
}
```

## Ask students to deliver a link

The default format to deliver a project is by specifying a GitHub repository URL with the following structure:

```text
https://github.com/<github_username>/<github_repository>
```

You can override that behavior by specifying a `regex`:

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "formats": ["url"],
    "regex": "https://github.com/"
  }
}
```

**More URL examples:**

### URL from docs.google.com

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "instructions": {
      "us": "Pase the URL of the Google Sheets template with the different strategies discussed during the game",
      "es": "Agrega el URL al document de Google Sheets con las diferentes strategies discutidas"
    },
    "formats": ["url"],
    "regex": "https://docs.google.com/"
  }
}
```

### URL from anywhere (generic)

Leave the `regex` key with `https://` only. The system will ensure a valid URL is provided.

```json filename="learn.json"
{
  "delivery": {
    "instructions": {
      "us": "Pase the URL of the Google Sheets template with the different strategies discussed during the game",
      "es": "Agrega el URL al document de Google Sheets con las diferentes strategies discutidas"
    },
    "formats": ["url"],
    "regex": "https://"
  }
}
```
