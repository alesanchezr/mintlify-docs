# Getting started with LearnPack as a creator

There are two ways to use LearnPack: as a **creator** of interactive tutorials, or as a **learner** consuming those tutorials. This guide focuses on the creator path.

<Callout type="info">
<b><span style={{color:"#4F46E5"}}>Prerequisites:</span></b> Make sure you have Node.js installed, then install the LearnPack CLI. Find the package on npm: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@learnpack/learnpack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>@learnpack/learnpack</b></a>.
</Callout>

## Start your first tutorial

Follow these steps to create a tutorial project.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI globally">
    Run:
    <br />
    <code>npm install -g @learnpack/learnpack</code>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the project">
    In an empty folder, run:
    <br />
    <code>learnpack init</code>
    <br />
    The wizard will ask about your tutorialâ€™s configuration and then scaffold the project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Answer the setup questions">
    You will be prompted for:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Grading type</b> (see options below)</li>
      <li><b>Title</b> of the tutorial</li>
      <li><b>Description</b></li>
      <li><b>Difficulty</b> (Beginner, Easy, Intermediate, Hard)</li>
      <li><b>Estimated duration</b> (hours)</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Grading types at a glance

| Option | What it means | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Incremental** | You cannot move forward until the current exercise passes its tests. Later steps depend on earlier knowledge. | Progressive skill-building paths. |
| **Isolated** | Each exercise is independent. You can jump to any step in any order. | Drill practice or non-linear study. |
| **No grading** | No tests for exercises. | Reading tasks, demos, or exploratory content. |

<Callout type="tip">
<b>Tip:</b> Not sure about duration yet? Keep the default and adjust later while you iterate content.

## Project structure

After the wizard finishes, your tutorial files are created in a new directory:

![Directory files](https://github.com/learnpack/docs/blob/main/assets/initial-files.png)

Each exercise you add should follow the same basic structure:

- **README.md:** the learner-facing instructions.
- **Test file:** used if the tutorial is graded.
- **Entry file (e.g., <code>app.py</code> / <code>app.js</code>):** the code the learner edits.  
  The default filename can be overridden in configuration.

Add one folder per exercise and keep the structure consistent.

## What to do next

Once your project is scaffolded, start adding exercises and tests, then run LearnPack locally to preview the flow.
