# Create Quizzes in LearnPack

Quizzes help learners check understanding, think critically, and stay engaged. In LearnPack, quizzes are written in **plain Markdown**, then rendered as interactive content using simple formatting rules.

<Callout type="info">
  <span style={{color:'#4F46E5'}}><strong>Works with plain Markdown:</strong></span> write questions and options using standard Markdown checkboxes, LearnPack handles the rest.
</Callout>

## Key rules

### Structure of a quiz

* **Question title:** the question text itself.
* **Blank line:** leave one empty line after the title.
* **Options:** use a checklist

  * Incorrect: `- [ ]`
  * Correct: `- [x]`

### One correct answer

* Each question must have **only one** correct option.

### Proper indentation

* Indent options by **3â€“6 spaces** beneath the question title.
* Incorrect indentation causes parsing to fail.

### Blank line between title and options

* Always include a **blank line** between the question title and its options.
